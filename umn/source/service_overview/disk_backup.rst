Disk Backup
===========

What Is Disk Backup?
--------------------

Cloud Disk Backup provided by Cloud Backup and Recovery (CBR) allows you to create backups for your EVS disks while servers are running. If data loss or damage occurred due to virus invasions, accidental deletions, or software/hardware faults, you can use backups to restore data, guaranteeing your data integrity and security.

For more information, see the *Cloud Backup and Recovery User Guide*.

Who Can Use the Backup Function?
--------------------------------

Only users with the CBR FullAccess permissions can use the cloud disk backup function. If the user does not have the permissions, contact the account administrator to grant the permissions first.

Application Scenarios
---------------------

Create and apply backup policies to schedule periodic backups for your EVS disks. You can use the backup data to create new EVS disks or restore to source disks.

EVS Backup
==========

What Is EVS Backup?
-------------------

Cloud Disk Backup provided by Cloud Backup and Recovery (CBR) allows you to create backups for your EVS disks while servers are running. If data loss or damage occurred due to virus invasions, misoperations, or software and hardware faults, you can use backups to restore data, guaranteeing your data integrity and security.

For more information, see the *Cloud Backup and Recovery User Guide*.

Application Scenarios
---------------------

Create and apply backup policies to schedule periodic backups for your EVS disks. You can use the backup data to create new EVS disks or restore to source disks.

Usage Instructions
------------------

For how to back up EVS disks, see :ref:`Managing EVS Backup <evs_01_0110>` or the *Cloud Backup and Recovery User Guide*.

Can I Roll Back the Data from a Snapshot After Reinstalling the OS or Formatting the Disk?
==========================================================================================

-  If you have reinstalled or changed the server OS, snapshots of the system disk are automatically deleted. Snapshots of the data disks can be used as usual.
-  If you have formatted a disk, snapshots can still be used to roll back the disk data.

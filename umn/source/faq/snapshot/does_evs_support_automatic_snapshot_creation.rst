Does EVS Support Automatic Snapshot Creation?
=============================================

No, but you can develop a program to periodically create snapshots through APIs. Alternatively, you may use the CBR service and enable auto backup to create backups periodically. For details, see section "Creating a Backup Policy" in the *Cloud Backup and Recovery User Guide*.

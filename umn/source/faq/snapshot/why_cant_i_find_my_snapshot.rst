Why Can't I Find My Snapshot?
=============================

Possible causes are:

-  You have manually deleted the snapshot.
-  You have deleted the snapshot's source disk. Then, all the snapshots created for this disk will be deleted automatically.
-  You have reinstalled or changed the server OS. System disk snapshots will be automatically deleted after a server OS has been reinstalled or changed.

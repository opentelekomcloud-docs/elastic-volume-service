What Should I Do If My EVS Replication Quotas Are Insufficient? (Deprecated)
============================================================================

If the system displays a message indicating insufficient quota during an EVS replication pair creation or a replication consistency group creation or update, contact the administrator to handle this issue.

.. note::

   EVS replication APIs have been deprecated. If you need to use the replication function, see `Storage Disaster Recovery Service User Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/sdrs/en-us_topic_0125068221.html>`__ and `Storage Disaster Recovery Service API Reference <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/api/sdrs/sdrs_01_0000.html>`__.

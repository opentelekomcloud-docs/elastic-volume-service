Can I Attach a Shared Disk to Servers Running Different OSs?
============================================================

-  It is recommended that you do not simultaneously attach a shared disk to servers running Linux and Windows.
-  If a shared disk is attached to servers running different versions of the same OS type, it can be used normally. For example, a shared disk attached to one server running CentOS 6 and another server running CentOS 7 can work fine.

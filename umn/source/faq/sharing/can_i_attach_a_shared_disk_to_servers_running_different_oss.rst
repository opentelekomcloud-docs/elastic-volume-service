Can I Attach a Shared Disk to Servers Running Different OSs?
============================================================

-  It is recommended that you do not attach a shared disk to both Linux and Windows servers.
-  If you attach a shared disk to servers running different versions of the same OS type, for example CentOS 9 and CentOS 7 servers, you can use the shared disk normally.

Can I Attach a Disk to Multiple Servers?
========================================

-  A non-shared disk can only be attached to one server.
-  A shared disk can be attached to up to 16 servers.

   .. note::

      -  Shared disks are a type of EVS disks that can be attached to multiple servers.
      -  A shared file system or cluster management system must be set up before you can properly use a shared disk. If you simply attach a shared disk to multiple servers, data cannot be shared between those servers and may be overwritten.

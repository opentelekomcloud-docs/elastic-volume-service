Can I Attach a Disk to Multiple Servers?
========================================

-  A non-shared disk can only be attached to one server.
-  A shared disk can be attached to up to 16 servers.

   .. note::

      -  Shared disks are a type of EVS disks that can be attached to multiple servers.
      -  To use shared disks, you must set up a shared file system or cluster management system. If you directly attach a disk to multiple servers, the disk sharing attribute does not work and data may be overwritten.

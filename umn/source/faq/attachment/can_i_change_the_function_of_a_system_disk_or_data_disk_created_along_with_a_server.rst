Can I Change the Function of a System Disk or Data Disk Created Along with a Server?
====================================================================================

This section describes how to change the function of a disk on the original server.

-  System disk created along with a server: You can detach the system disk and then re-attach it to the same server as a system disk or data disk.

   .. note::

      Each server can only have one system disk. If there is already a system disk attached to the server, then the detached system disk cannot be attached as a second system disk.

-  Data disk created along with a server: You can detach the data disk and then re-attach it to the same server only as a data disk. It cannot be attached as a system disk.

What Should I Do If a Linux EVS Disk Is Attached to a Windows Server?
=====================================================================

You are advised not to attach a Linux EVS disk to a Windows server or attach a Windows EVS disk to a Linux server.

The disk information may fail to be displayed due to the inconsistent file systems. To solve this issue, you need to initialize and partition the disk again. Formatting the disk will destroy any data the disk has contained, so you should back up the data first.

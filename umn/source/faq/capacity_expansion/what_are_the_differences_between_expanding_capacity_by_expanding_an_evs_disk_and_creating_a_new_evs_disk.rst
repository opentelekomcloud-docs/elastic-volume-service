What Are the Differences Between Expanding Capacity by Expanding an EVS Disk and Creating a New EVS Disk?
=========================================================================================================

The differences are as follows:

-  Expanding an EVS disk is when you expand the capacity of an existing EVS disk. Some systems let you expand the capacity of EVS disks in use. In this case, services are not interrupted.
-  If you create a new EVS disk and attach it to a server that already has an existing EVS disk, the new EVS disk and the original EVS disk are attached to the same server but independent from each other.

Why Did My Disk Capacity Remain Unchanged on the Server After Capacity Expansion?
=================================================================================

After expanding disk capacity on the console, you must log in to the server and extend the disk partition and file system for the extra capacity to become available. Otherwise, you cannot view the additional space on the server.

To extend disk partitions and file systems, see the following sections:

-  :ref:`Extending Disk Partitions and File Systems (Linux) <evs_01_0094>`
-  :ref:`Extending Disk Partitions and File Systems (Windows Server 2016) <evs_01_0126>`

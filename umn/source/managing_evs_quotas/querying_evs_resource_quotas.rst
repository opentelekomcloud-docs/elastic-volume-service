Querying EVS Resource Quotas
============================

Scenarios
---------

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users, such as the number of EVS disks, the capacity of EVS disks, and the number of EVS snapshots.

Users can perform the following operations to view the resource quota details.

Procedure
---------

#. Sign in to the console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.

#. Click |image2| in the upper left corner and choose **Storage** > **Elastic Volume Service**.

#. In the upper right corner of the page, click |image3|.

   The **Service Quota** page is displayed.

#. View the used and total quota of each type of resources on the displayed page.

   If a quota cannot meet service requirements, apply for a higher quota.
